4 Pillars of OOPS:
    -Abstraction
    -Encapsulation
    -Inheritance
    -Polymorphism

ABSTRACTION
  - Hides unnecessary details from a user, and showcase only what is necessary.
Eg: TV underhood don't know how it runs, but we interface i.e remote

ENCAPSULATION
  - Like a capsule has everything inside it. Same concept i.e characters and behaviour are inside the class

 class Car{
   //variables-characters
   //Methods-Behaviour
 }

    ACCESS MODIFIERS
1.Private(default)  => data & methods accessible inside the class       
2.Public => data & methods accessible to everyone               
3.Protected => data & methods accessible inside the class & to its derived class
