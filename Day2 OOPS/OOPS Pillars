4 Pillars of OOPS:
    -Abstraction
    -Encapsulation
    -Inheritance
    -Polymorphism

ABSTRACTION
  - Hides unnecessary details from a user, and showcase only what is necessary.
Eg: TV underhood don't know how it runs, but we interface i.e remote

ENCAPSULATION
  - Like a capsule has everything inside it. Same concept i.e characters and behaviour are inside the class

 class Car{
   //variables-characters
   //Methods-Behaviour
 }
 Access Modifiers
    ->Public
    ->Private
    ->Protected
