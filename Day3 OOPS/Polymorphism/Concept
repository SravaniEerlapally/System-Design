Polymorphism
  One stimulus->different responses based on situation/object

Method Overriding:(Run Time)
  When a child class has a method with the same name and same parameters as in its parent class, and it provides its own version of the method.

Method Overloading:(Compile Time)
   Multiple methods with the same name exist but have different parameters in the same class.


Q)Define Operator Overloading?
A)The Concept of defining operators to work with objects and structure variables is known as operator overloading.
   ->The + operator, when used with values of type int, returns their sum. 
   ->But when used with objects of a user-defined type, it gives an error.We define the behavior of the + operator to work with objects as well.

Q)Why Operator Overloading is not supported in Java?
A) ->Java does not support Operator Overloading to keep the "Language Simple", "Prevent Misuse", and "Ensure Code Readability". 
  ->Javaâ€™s design prioritizes clarity and consistency, which is why operators in Java have a fixed, well-defined meaning.
  How does it do then?  //Method Overloading
    ->Instead of operator overloading, Java encourages the use of Method overloading to achieve similar functionality in a more straightforward way. 
    ->This keeps Java code easier to read and maintain, especially in large projects.

Q)Why Operator Overloading is supported in Python?
A)Operator Overloading in Python is done using special functions or magic methods.
  ->Python internally calls the __add__() method. This same principle applies to other operators such as -, *, ==, etc.
  By Overloading Operators:
    ->Custom classes (e.g., Vector, Complex, Matrix) can support natural expressions like v1 + v2
    ->This makes code cleaner, more intuitive, and similar to how operations are done with basic types
