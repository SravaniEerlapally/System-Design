                           |Sequence Diagram|
                           ==================
    A ------------------>B
      <------------------
Sequence Diagram- Tells the interaction/communication between A and B
            
1.Represent diagrams of classes as ðŸ„° ðŸ„± ðŸ„² ðŸ„³

2.Lifeline - tells till what time that object exists in application.

3.Activation Bar - tells at what particular time the objects are active.
          When active then objects can receive and send messages
          When inactive then it can't receive nor send any messages

4.Messages
 /     \
Async   Sync

Synchronous- wait for the response of message.
 sync messages  - denoted with closed triangle arrow. straiightline------------â–·
 response messages - denoted with dotted closed triangle arrow. ................â–·
         ðŸ„°               ðŸ„±

Asynchronous- won't wait for the response of message
   denoted with open triangle arrow.--------------->

Create Message

   ATM Transaction Flow
1.Person----->ATM
 Acc,Amount
2.ATM---->Transaction


Things to remember before drawing Sequence Diagram:
==================================================
1.Use-Case
2.Objects (Involved ->ATM,User,Transaction,Account,Cash Dispenser)
3.Draw sequence diagram
