-------------------------------------------------------------------DSA is brain of an application then LLD is skeleton of application.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1Q)What is LLD?
A) LLD stands for Low-Level-Design.It handles the "Code Structure" of the application.Building an application with multiple DSA Concepts i.e LLD.
   Code Structure
      -Object/Entities [Users,Riders,Location, Notification, Payment]
      -Relationships [relationships b/w these objects users->riders, riders->loacation etc]
      -Data Security
      -Handle Millions of Users

2Q)What are the 3pillars of LLD?
A)  i)Scalability  [How does our application runs when millions of users use this appliaction]
   ii)Maintainability [-Code must be easily debuggable(minimal bugs,findable) and  
                       -adding a new feature to existing application must not affect the older code,it should run as before and new feature must be easily integrated to our application]
  iii)Reusabaility [it should easily plug & play (application independent), it should not be tightly-coupled]
      Eg: Rider Mapping Algorithm- Zomato, Ola (this code can be reused in various applications)

3Q)What is HLD?
A) HLD stands for High-Level Design. It handles the "System Architecture" of the application.
   System Architecture
     -What TechStack do we use? [Java,Node]
     -Which Databases do we use? [SQL,NoSQL]
     -How Servers would be Scale?
     -Cost Optmization
